// A method in golang is nothing but a function with a receiver
// The method will have access to the properties of the receiver and can call the receiverâ€™s other methods
// Since method lets you define a function on a type, it lets you write object-oriented code in Golang. There are also some other benefits such as two different methods can have the same name in the same package which is not possible with functions

// func (receiver receiver_type) some_func_name(arguments) return_values

// There can exist different methods with the same name with a different receiver, but there cannot exist two different functions with the same name in the same package.
